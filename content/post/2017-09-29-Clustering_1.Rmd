## Cluster analysis

This is a broad topic and could probably cover most of a semester, if you want more in depth start by looking at:

[![Cluster book](http://www.sthda.com/english/upload/practical_guide_to_cluster_analysis.png)](http://www.sthda.com/english/web/5-bookadvisor/17-practical-guide-to-cluster-analysis-in-r/)


### The background

- Cluster analysis is a broad group of multivariate techniques to identify homogenous groups
    - maximizes between group variation and minimizing within group variation 
    - outcome:  reduction of observations into fewer groups
    - often used in data mining or exploratory approaches
    - works best when there are inherent discontinuities in the data
         -  if the data is continuous, ordination techniques may be preferred
         - ordination may force groups that do not exist 
         
- Occurs in two basic steps:
    1. measure of similarity betewen observations is specified
    2. Using this distance (and a clustering rule) observations are grouped based on either a hierarchical or partitioning technique
    3.  Once a new cluster is formed, distances between clusters are based on single linkage (minimum distance), complete linkage (maximum method), or average linkage

- Hiercharchical techniques are useful because they can reveal relationships in a nested fashion (i.e., phylogenetic tree)
    - not efficient for large data sets (> 500 obs)
    
- Unlike hierarchical, partitioning does not require dissimilarity matrices

- Partitioning methods follow four iterative steps:
    1. randomly assign cluster centroids
    2. classify clusters based on the closest centroid
    3. recaculate the centroid after each observation is added
    4. repeat steps1-3 until within cluster variation is minimized

- Limitations of clustering
    - exploratory or hypothesis generating tool
    - Be considerate of using mixed data types.  Gower's distance should not be used in hierarchical analysis
    - Assumes distance measures follow a normal or multinomial distribution
    - clustering variables are appropriate for group separation
    - Can be influenced by scale and units
    - visual classifications are selective

### Now on to the doing

We are going to use non-ecological data in this excersize to illustrate the different types of data that can be incorporated into this type of analysis

```{r}
data("USArrests")
glimpse(USArrests)
```

Lets scale the data 
```{r}
USArrests %>% 
  scale() -> arrest.scale

head(arrest.scale)
```

lets convert this to a distance matrix using the `factoextra::get_dist()` function.

```{r}
arrest.scale %>% 
  get_dist(upper = TRUE, diag = TRUE) -> arrest.dist
```

Visualizing the distance matrix

```{r}

arrest.dist.df <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(arrest.dist))
arrest.dist.df$row <- rownames(arrest.dist.df)

arrest.dist.df %>% 
  gather(col, value, -row) -> arrest_long
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = arrest_long) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = col,y=row, fill = value)) +
  coord_equal(expand = F) +
  scale_fill_gradient2( low = "red", mid = "white", high = "blue", midpoint = 3) +
theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank())
```
