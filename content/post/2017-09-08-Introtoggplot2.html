<p>This class covers an introduction to graphing using the functions from <code>ggplot2</code>. Similar to the introduction with <code>tidyverse</code> This is only meant to serve as a brief introduction and we will keep developing these skills throughout the semester. I have similar lessons graphing from a previous semester <a href="https://chrischizinski.github.io/SNR_R_Group/2016-10-03-BasicPlots">2016-10-03-BasicPlots</a> and information on themes, facetting, and saving plots <a href="https://chrischizinski.github.io/SNR_R_Group/2016-10-05-Themes_Facets">2016-10-05-Themes_Facets</a>.</p>
