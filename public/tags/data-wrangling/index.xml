      <description>Very often when we are working with datasets, particularly databases, we often want to combine multiple datasets. Traditionally, in R, this was done with the function merge(). Since the development of the tidyverse there has been improvements on the types and speed of joins. The joins available in the dplyr() package follow those in SQL type joins.
We will explore these types of joins using datasets from the our github repository</description>

      <description>All the data that we use is in our repository.
Now that you have your data in R, no matter the process you took to get it there, you will undoubtedly need to manipulate the data. Manipulation (i.e. tidying) will involve getting your data in a format and “looking” the way you want so you can analyze the data. This does not sound like a big process but until a few years ago it was.</description>
